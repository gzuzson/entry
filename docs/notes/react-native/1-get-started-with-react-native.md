# Get started with React Native

We believe that the best way to experience React Native is through a
**Framework**, a toolbox with all the necessary APIs to let you build production
ready apps. 

You can also use React Native without a Framework, however, we've found that
most devs benefit from using a React Native Framework like Expo. Expo provides
features like file-based routing, high-quality universal libraries, and the
ability to write plugins that modify native code without having to manage native
files.
