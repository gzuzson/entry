entry is a journalling application aimed to provide to users the ability to organise thought
through a colour-coordinated approach to journalling.  Users will be able to write journal entries 
within the application, and will be provided the function to highlight certain passages of each entry. 
Users will be able to categorise thoughts by assigning colours to different categories, whereby each 
highlight colour will represent a category of thought; i.e., red for thoughts of anger, blue for thoughts
of depression, etc.  

entry is a colour-coordinated approach to organising thought through the practice of journalling.
